# automation-bot-For-midjourney
An open-source Python program to automate generating images using the Midjourney bot on Discord. The program uses Selenium and OpenAIâ€™s GPT-3.5 to generate image prompts and then downloads the bot-generated image.

It then generates captions and hashtags using OpenAI's API for the images before uploading them onto Instagram.
